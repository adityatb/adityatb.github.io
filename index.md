As an electronics engineer with a penchant for music, my career has taken an interesting trajectory. I've transitioned from a sound recordist to a machine learning scientist/engineer. My curious and meticulous nature has led me to explore various domains deeply. My journey started with the carnatic classical voice training and eventually blues guitar and classical violin. I got into music production and composition professionally, which brought me closer to signal processing and haptic feedback in music. 

The diverse areas constantly involved adapting and iterating to improve audio outputs by optimizing a suitable statistical heuristic with gradual iterative steps, i.e. the doorstep of Machine Learning. Pretty soon, before anyone could say `adaptive filter`, I was poking around with hyperplanes, clusterings, regressions and lost deep in the world of audio deep learning. My work has spanned areas like noise reduction, blind source separation, differentiable audio signal processing. More recently, my professional focus has been on speaker verification systems and leading the [audio deepfake detection efforts at Resemble AI](https://www.resemble.ai/detect/), while more generally I spend my life overthinking the nuances of [techno-feudalism with a side of artificial intelligence](https://www.ted.com/talks/yanis_varoufakis_capitalism_will_eat_democracy_unless_we_speak_up) and the existential capitalist [moloch traps](https://www.ted.com/talks/liv_boeree_the_dark_side_of_competition_in_ai) that we're seemingly always walking into.

I'm always open to chat about these topics or generally advise other humans finding themselves taking a similar journey to mine and help re-cycle some my experiences into theirs.
