Iâ€™m an electronics engineer with a musical twist that turned into a sound recordist and turned into a machine learning scientist/engineer. I generally have a curious mind and like to explore new things. I went from guitar to music production, then over to signal processing and haptic feedback in music, and somehow went to deep learning with audio signals. From noise reduction, blind source separation, differentiable audio signal processing and now to deepfake detection in audio. Hmu - I like to chat about this stuff.
