publications:
  - name: "Defining a vibrotactile toolkit for digital musical instruments: characterizing voice coil actuators, effects of loading, and equalization of the
frequency response"
    publisher: "Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces 14, Springer"
    releaseDate: "2020-07-01"
    website: "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12193-020-00340-0"
    summary: "Given the extreme requirements of musical performances, there is a need for solutions allowing for independent control of frequency and amplitude over a wide frequency bandwidth (40–1000 Hz) and low harmonic distortion, so that flexible and high-quality vibrotactile feedback can be displayed. In this paper, we evaluate cost-effective and portable solutions that meet these requirements."

  - name: "Autoregressive parameter estimation for equalizing vibrotactile systems"
    publisher: "International Workshop on Haptic and Audio Interaction Design-HAID2019"
    releaseDate: "2019-03-10"
    website: "https://hal.science/hal-02013514v2/document"
    summary: "For advanced musical use, it is essential to perform the characterization of the amplifiers and actuators
involved, as well as the equalization of their overall frequency response characteristics, a step typically implemented with the help
of manually configured parametric equalizers. This paper proposes
an autoregressive method that automatically estimates minimum-phase filter parameters, which by design, remain stable upon inversion."
